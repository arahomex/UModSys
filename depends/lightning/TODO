	* Validate that divrem in jit_x86-cpu.c is not modifying
	the non result arguments. This is not verified by clobber.tst,
	as it only checks registers not involved in the operation
	(because it does not know about values being set as input
	for the the operation).

	* Write a simple higher level language implementation generating
	jit with lightning, that could be some lisp or C like language.
