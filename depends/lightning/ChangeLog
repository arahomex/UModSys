2013-12-03 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_x86-x87.c: Correct wrong optimization when
	loading the log(2) constant.

2013-12-03 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_x86-cpu.c: Use the emms instruction before
	calling any function. This is particularly important
	when using c99 complex functions as it can easily
	overflow the x87 stack due to the way lightning uses
	the x87 stack as a flat register file.

2013-12-02 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_x86-x87.c: Correct wrong code generation due
	to comparing the base and not the value register with
	%st(0) in stxi_f.

2013-12-02 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_x86-x87.c, lib/jit_x86.c: Use 8 bytes aligned
	stack offset for float/double x87 to/from sse move.

2013-11-27 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* configure.ac, lib/jit_arm-swf.c, lib/jit_arm.c: Add
	changes that should at least allow building lightning
	on Apple iOS7.

2013-10-08 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_ppc-cpu.c: Correct wrong shortcut for ldxi_l with
	a zero offset, that was calling ldr_i instead of ldr_l.

2013-10-08 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning/jit_arm.h, lib/jit_arm-cpu.c: Do not use
	by default load/store instructions that map to ldrt/strt.
	There is already the long displacement version for positive
	offsets, and when using a (shorter) negative offset it does
	not map to ldrt/strt. At least on qemu strt may cause
	reproducible, but unexpected SIGILL.

2013-10-08 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_arm-vfp.c: Correct wrong load/store offset
	calculation when the displacement is constant but too
	large to use an instruction with an immediate offset.

2013-10-07 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/self.c: Extend tests to validate jit_callee_save_p
	does not cause an assertion on valid arguments, and test
	extra registers defined on some backends.

	* configure.ac: Do not ignore environment CFLAGS when
	checking if need to test runtime configurable options,
	like use x87 when sse2 is available, arm instruction set
	instead of thumb, etc.

	* include/lightning/jit_arm.h: Correct wrong jit_f macro
	definition.

	* include/lightning/jit_ia64.h, include/lightning/jit_ppc.h: 
	Correct wrong jit_r macro definition.

	* lib/jit_x86-x87.c, lib/jit_x86.c: Actually use the
	reserved stack space for integer to/from float conversion.
	The stack space was also changed to ensure it is 8 bytes
	aligned. Also, for Solaris x86 in 32 bit mode, an alternate
	truncr_d was implemented because for some reason it is
	failing with SIGILL if using the "fisttpl" instructions,
	that must be available on p6 or newer, but for the sake of
	making all tests pass, implement a 486 or newer sequence
	if "sun" is defined.

2013-10-03 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning/jit_mips.h, lib/jit_mips-cpu.c,
	lib/jit_mips-sz.c, lib/jit_mips.c, size: Build and
	pass all test cases on Irix big endian mips using
	the 64 bit abi.

2013-10-02 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning/jit_mips.h: Add proper mips abi detection.

2013-09-30 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_print.c: Do not crash if calling jit_print from
	gdb before actually emitting code.

	* lib/lightning.c: Correct misplaced check for already
	visited blocks on conditional branches, what was preventing
	proper merge live bit masks of forward blocks.

2013-09-30 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_x86-cpu.c: Correct not properly tested case of using
	%r12 as index register, what was causing an invalid assertion.
	%r12 is mapped to the "extra" JIT_R3 register, and test cases
	only test "standard" lightning registers.

2013-09-28 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_ia64.c: Minor change to force collecting the maximum
	instruction length in the --enable-devel-get-jit-size build
	mode. The actual generated file did not change because the
	sampling was large enough that it had already collected proper
	information in the previously slightly buggy code (not forcing
	a sync of the instructions that could be combined).

2013-09-27 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_arm.c: Correct build when disassembler is
	disabled.

2013-09-25 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_ia64-cpu.c, lib/jit_ia64-fpu.c: Correct some
	off by one range checks (that were only accepting values
	one less than the maximum allowed) and an invalid test
	condition check that was forcing it to always use
	indirect jumps even when reachable with an immediate
	displacement.

2013-09-24 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_aarch64-sz.c, lib/jit_arm-sz.c, lib/jit_hppa-sz.c,
	lib/jit_ia64-sz.c, lib/jit_mips-sz.c, lib/jit_ppc-sz.c,
	lib/jit_s390x-sz.c, lib/jit_size.c, lib/jit_sparc-sz.c,
	lib/jit_x86-sz.c: New files implementing static tables
	with longest known instructions length generated to match
	a lightning instruction. These tables should make it easier
	to make it very unlikely to ever miscalculate, or by too
	much, the size of a code buffer.

	* lib/jit_size.c: New file that aids to either collect
	jit code size information, or use the information depending
	on build options.

	* size.c: New helper file that parses input for, and create
	an initial jit_$arch-sz.c file, that needs some minor edit
	for arches with multiple configurations.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am: Add the new, devel mode only
	--enable-devel-get-jit-size configure option, that sets
	compile time flags to collect jit code size information,
	that will be used as input for the "noinst size program".

	* lib/jit_aarch64.c, lib/jit_arm.c, lib/jit_disasm.c,
	lib/jit_hppa.c, lib/jit_ia64.c, lib/jit_memory.c,
	lib/jit_mips.c, lib/jit_ppc.c, lib/jit_s390x.c,
	lib/jit_sparc.c, lib/jit_x86.c, lib/lightning.c: Minor
	changes for the --enable-devel-get-jit-size build mode,
	as well as the "production build mode" with jit code
	size information.

2013-09-14 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning.h, lib/lightning.c: Add the new
	jit_pointer_p interface, that returns a boolean value
	telling if the pointer argument is inside the jit
	code buffer. This is useful to avoid the need to add
	extra labels and calls to jit_address to figure bounds
	of code buffer, and still keep internal data private.

2013-09-13 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning.h, include/lightning/jit_private.h,
	lib/jit_note.c: Change the code argument of jit_get_note
	to a jit_pointer_t and make jit_get_note a public interface.
	It was intended so since start, as a way to map an offset
	in the code to a function name, file name and line number
	mapping.

2013-09-11 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* doc/body.texi: Correct reversed arguments in example of
	usage in a (possibly) multi threaded, multiple jit_state_t
	environments.

	* include/lightning/jit_arm.h, include/lightning/jit_private.h,
	lib/jit_arm-cpu.c, lib/jit_arm.c: Make a previously, non
	documented, global state private to the related jit_state_t
	generating code.

2013-09-10 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/self.c, check/self.ok: New files implementing simple
	consistency check assertions. At first validating some macros
	that use values from different sources agree.

	* check/Makefile.am: Update for the new test case.

	* include/lightning.h,  lib/lightning.c: Add the new
	jit_callee_save_p() call, that is intended to be used when
	writing complex code using lightning, so that one does not
	need to verify what backend is being used, or have access to
	private data, to query if a register is callee save or not;
	on several backends the scratch registers are actually callee
	save.

	* include/lightning/jit_aarch64.h, include/lightning/jit_arm.h,
	include/lightning/jit_hppa.h, include/lightning/jit_mips.h,
	include/lightning/jit_ppc.h, include/lightning/jit_sparc.h,
	include/lightning/jit_x86.h: Add an explicit definition for
	JIT_R3-JIT_Rn, JIT_V3-JIT_Vn and JIT_F6-JIT_Fn when applicable.
	This allows one to write code based on "#if defined(JIT_XN)"
	and therefore, not need to check what is the current backend
	or have access to private data structures. This is particularly
	useful when writing virtual machines with several specialized,
	global registers.

	* lib/jit_ia64.c: Properly flag the callee save general
	purpose registers as such, so that jit_callee_save_p() works
	as intended.

2013-09-10 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/lightning.c, configure.ac: Conditionally use the
	code written to workaround a bug in the Hercules emulator,
	as isnan and isinf are not available at least on HP-UX ia64.

2013-09-10 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_s390x-cpu.c: Spill/reload correct callee save
	float registers.

2013-09-10 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_hppa-cpu.c: Correct code to call a function stored
	in a register or a patched function address.

2013-09-10 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_ia64-cpu.c: Correct incorrect logic when restoring
	the value of the "r2" callee save register.

2013-08-29 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_arm-cpu.c, lib/jit_arm.c: Correct wrong test and update
	of the thumb offset information, when checking if needing to
	patch a jump from arm to thumb mode. The problem would happen when
	remapping the code buffer, and the new address being lower than
	the previous one.

2013-08-26 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* configure.ac: Extend FreeBSD test to also handle NetBSD.

	* lib/jit_x86-cpu.c: Correct wrongly defined offset type of
	ldxi_ui. Problem detected when building on NetBSD.

	* lib/lightning.c: Adjust code to handle NetBSD mremap,
	where arguments do not match Linux mremap.

2013-08-26 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_ppc.c: Correct C sequence point problem miscalculating
	the actual function address in a function descriptor. Problem
	happens with gcc 4.8.1 at least.

2013-08-11 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_s390x-cpu.c: Correct code checking if immediate
	fits instruction, but using the negated value.

2013-07-28 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning/jit_s390x.h, lib/jit_s390x-cpu.c,
	lib/jit_s390x-fpu.c, lib/jit_s390x.c: New files
	implementing the new s390x port.

	* configure.ac, include/lightning.h,
	include/lightning/Makefile.am,
	include/lightning/jit_private.h,
	lib/Makefile.am, lib/jit_disasm.c, lib/lightning.c:
	Minor adaptation for the new s390x backend.

	* check/float.tst: Update for the s390x result of
	truncating +Inf to integer.

	* check/qalu_mul.tst: Add extra test cases to better test
	high word of signed multiplication as the result is
	adjust from unsigned multiplication on s390x.

2013-07-28 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/lightning.c: Do not assume casting a double NaN or
	Inf to float will produce the expected float NaN or Inf.
	This is not true at least under s390x.

2013-07-28 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/check.arm.sh, check/check.sh, check/check.swf.sh,
	check/check.x87.sh: Properly check test programs output,
	not just rely on the test program self testing the results
	and not crashing.

2013-07-28 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_aarch64.c: Remove unused macros left from cut&paste
	of jit_arm.c.

2013-07-16 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning/jit_aarch64.h, lib/jit_aarch64-cpu.c,
	lib/jit_aarch64-fpu.c, lib/jit_aarch64.c: New files
	implementing the new aarch64 port, as a new architecture,
	not as an expansion of the existing armv[4-7] port.

	* check/lightning.c: Add aarch64 support and a small
	change to recognize character constants as immediate
	values.

	* check/float.tst: Add aarch64 preprocessor conditionals
	to select proper expected value when converting [+-]Inf
	and NaN to integer.

	* include/lightning/jit_arm.h, lib/jit_arm.c: Minor changes
	to better match the new aarch64 files.

	* configure.ac, include/lightning.h,
	include/lightning/Makefile.am, include/lightning/jit_private.h,
	lib/Makefile.am, lib/lightning.c: Minor adjustments
	for the aarch64 port.

2013-07-08 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* NEWS, THANKS, configure.ac, doc/version.texi: Update for
	the 1.99a second alpha release.

2013-06-25 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_mips.c: Correct cut&paste error that caused wrong
	stack offset calculation for double arguments in stack in
	the o32 abi.
	Correct typo in the __LITTLE_ENDIAN macro name, that came
	from cut&paste error in the original typo in lib/jit_ppc.c.

	* lib/jit_ia64.c, lib/jit_ppc.c: Correct typo in the
	__LITTLE_ENDIAN macro name.

2013-06-22 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/lightning.c, configure.ac, include/lightning.h,
	lib/lightning.c: Add tests and quirks to build/detect
	and/or work on Irix.

	* include/lightning/jit_mips.h, lib/jit_mips-cpu.c,
	lib/jit_mips-fpu.c, lib/jit_mips.c: Adapt code to run
	in big endian mips, using the n32 abi.

2013-06-18 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning.h: Minor extra preprocessor testing
	to "detect" byte order on x86 solaris, that now builds
	and pass all test cases.

2013-06-18 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_sparc-cpu.c: Correct compiler warning of value
	used before assignment. The usage is bogus as the api
	requires always patching jumps, but the random value used
	could cause an assertion due to invalid displacement.

	* lib/jit_sparc.c: Always load and store double arguments
	in stack as 2 float loads or stores, for safety, as unaligned
	access is not allowed in Sparc Solaris.

2013-06-14 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* configure.ac: Force -mlp64 to CFLAGS on HP-UX ia64 port.
	It is the only supported mode, and expects gcc as C compiler.

	* include/lightning.h, lib/jit_ia64-cpu.c, lib/jit_ia64.c:
	Correct ia64 port to work on HP-UX that runs it in big endian
	mode.

2013-06-10 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_hppa.c: Sanitize the cache synchronization inline
	assembly code that was doing twice the work and redundantly
	flushing the end address every loop iteration.

2013-06-09 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* configure.ac, check/Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.am: Do not
	explicitly link to -ldl, but instead autodetect the library
	with dlopen, dlsym, etc.

	* check/lightning.c: Add workaround to apparently buggy
	getopt in HP-UX that sets optind to the wrong index, and
	use RTLD_NEXT on HP-UX instead of RTLD_DEFAULT to dlsym
	global symbols.

	* include/lightning.h: Rework definitions of wordsize and
	byte order to detect proper values on HP-UX.

	* lib/lightning.c: Minor correction to use MAP_ANONYMOUS
	instead of MAP_ANON on HP-UX.

	* lib/jit_hppa.c: Float arguments must be passed on integer
	registers on HP-UX, not only for varargs functions.
	  Add code to properly clear instruction cache. This was
	not required on Debian hppa port, but may have been working
	by accident.

	* lib/jit_hppa-cpu.c: Follow pattern of HP-UX binaries and
	use bve,n instead of bv,n to return from functions.

	* lib/jit_hppa-fpu.c: For some reason "fst? frX,rX,(rY)" did
	not work on the tested computer	(HP-UX B.11.23 U 9000/785 HP-UX)
	so the code was changed, at first for __hpux only to add the
	base and offset register and use the instruction with an
	immediate (zero) offset.

2013-06-07 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/lightning.c, lib/jit_disasm.c, lib/jit_ppc-cpu.c,
	lib/jit_ppc-fpu.c, lib/jit_ppc.c, include/lightning.h,
	include/lightning/jit_ppc.h, include/lightning/jit_private.h:
	Adapt code to work on 32 bit AIX ppc using gcc. Most changes
	are basically to adapt the elf64 logic to 32 bit, as it does
	not use the same convention of 32 bit Darwin ppc.

	* check/stack.tst: Add a fake memcpy function to the test
	case if running under AIX, as it is not available to dlsym.

	* configure.ac: Check for getopt.h header, not available in
	AIX.

2013-06-01 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning/jit_hppa.h, lib/jit_hppa-cpu.c,
	lib/jit_hppa-fpu.c, lib/jit_hppa.c: New files implementing
	the hppa port. Built on Debian Linux PA-RISC 2.0, 32 bit.

	* check/float.tst: Add preprocessor for hppa expected
	values when converting NaN and +-Inf to an integer.

	* check/ldst.inc: Ensure double load/store tests use an
	8 byte aligned address by default.

	* lib/lightning.c: Correct a bug found during tests in
	the new port, where qmul* and qdiv* were not properly
	setting one of the result registers as modified in the
	function, what would be a problem if the only "write"
	usage were the qmul* or qdiv*.

	* check/varargs.tst, check/varargs.ok: Add one extra
	interleaved integer/double test to validate proper code
	generation in the extra case.

	* check/lightning.c, configure.ac, include/lightning.h,
	include/lightning/Makefile.am,
	include/lightning/jit_private.h, lib/Makefile.am,
	lib/jit_disasm.c: Update for the hppa port.

2013-04-27 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/varargs.tst: Correct misplaced .align directive
	that was causing the double buffer to not be aligned at
	8 bytes.
	* lib/jit_ia64-cpu.c:
	  Properly implement abi for excess arguments passed on
	stack.
	  Simplify load/store with immediate displacement argument
	with zero value.
	  Simplify some calls to "subi" changing to "addi" with
	a negative argument.
	  Remove some #if 0'ed code, that could be useful in
	special conditions, but the most useful one would be
	to "optimize" "static" jit functions, but for the sake
	of simplicity, jit functions are implemented in a way
	that can be passed back to C code as C function pointers.
	  Add an attribute to prototypes of several unused functions.
	These functions are defined for the sake of implementing all
	Itanium documented instructions, but a significant amount of
	them is not used by lightning.
	* lib/jit_ia64-fpu.c: Simplify load/store with zero immediate
	displacement and add unused attribute for functions not used
	by lightning, but required to provide macros implementing all
	Itanium documented instructions.
	* lib/jit_ia64.c: Update for the properly implemented abi
	for stack arguments.
	* lib/lightning.c: Mark an unused function as such.

2013-04-27 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	lib/jit_ia64-cpu.c:
	  Correct immediate range check of integer comparisons when
	inverting arguments.
	  Correct gei_u that was not decrementing immediate when
	inverting arguments.
	  Correct b?add* and b?sub* that were not properly updating
	the result register.

2013-04-27 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_ia64-cpu.c: Correct wrong mapping of 2 instructions
	in "M-, stop, M-, stop" translation, that was ignoring the
	last stop (implemented as a nop I- stop).

	* lib/jit_ia64-fpu.c: Properly implement fnorm.s and fnorm.d,
	as well as the proper integer to float or double conversion.

2013-04-27 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_ia64-cpu.c: Correct bogus implementation of ldr_T
	for signed integers, that was using ld1.s, ld2.s and ld4.s.
	The ".s" stands for speculative load, not sign extend.

	* lib/jit_ia64-fpu.c: Correct bogus implementation of ldxr_T
	for float and double. The third (actually, second) argument
	is indeed added to the base register, but the base register
	is modified. The actual M7 implementation was already correct,
	just the ldxr_f and ldxr_d implementation that was kept in
	a prototype state, misinterpreting what M7 does.

2013-04-27 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_ia64-cpu.c: Correct X2 pattern matching by preventing
	it to attempt to require a stop between the L and the X
	instruction; that is, check the registers and predicates
	before emitting the L instruction, not after.

	* lib/jit_ia64-fpu.c: Slightly simplify and correct
	divr_f and divrd_d implementation.

	* check/lightning.c: Add __ia64__ preprocessor define
	on Itanium. 

	* check/alu.inc, check/clobber.tst, check/float.tst: Define
	several macros conditionally to __ia64__. This is required
	because __ia64__ jit generation can use way too many memory,
	due to not implementing instruction reordering to avoid
	as much as possible "stops", what causes way too many nops
	to be generated, as well as the fact that division and
	remainder requires function calls, and float division
	requires significant code to implement.

2013-04-27 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning.h: Add new backend specific movr_w_d,
	movr_d_w and movi_d_w codes as helpers to ia64 varargs
	functions arguments.

	* lib/jit_ia64-cpu.c:
	  Correct wrong encoding of A5 small integers.
	  Correct define of "mux" instruction modifiers.
	  Correct ordering of arguments and predicates of cmp_xy
	implementation with immediate arguments; like most other
	codes with an immediate, the immediate is the second, not
	the third argument.

	* lib/jit_ia64-fpu.c: Actual implementation of the code
	to move to/from gpr to/from fpr, to implement varargs abi.

	* lib/jit_ia64.c: Make fpr argument registers not allocatable
	as temporaries, no need for the extra checks when there are
	plenty registers.

	* lib/jit_print.c, lib/lightning.c: Minor updates for the
	new movr_w_d, movr_d_w and movi_d_w codes.

2013-04-26 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_ia64-cpu.c, lib/jit_ia64-fpu.c: Correct code to
	also insert a stop to break an instruction group if a
	register is written more than once in the same group.
	This may happen if a register is argument and result of
	some lightning call (not a real instruction). The most
	common case should be code in the pattern:
		movl rn=largenum
		...
		mov rn=smallnum
	where "rn" would end up holding "largenum".
	But the problem possibly could happen in other circumstances.

2013-04-26 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning/jit_ia64.h, lib/jit_ia64-cpu.c,
	lib/jit_ia64-fpu.c, lib/jit_ia64.c:
	  Relocate JIT_Rn registers to the local registers, as, like
	float registers, div/rem and sqrt are implemented as function
	calls, and may overwrite non saved scratch registers.
	  Change patch_at to receive a jit_code_t instead of a
	jit_node_t, so that it is easier to "inline" patches when
	some instruction requires complex code to implement, e.g.
	uneq and ltgt.
	  Correct arguments to FMA and FMA like instructions that,
	due to a cut&paste error were passing the wrong argument
	to the related F- implementation function.
	  Rewrite ltgt to return the proper result if one (or both)
	of the arguments is unordered.

2013-04-26 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning/jit_ia64.h, include/lightning/jit_private.h,
	lib/jit_ia64-cpu.c, lib/jit_ia64-fpu.c, lib/jit_ia64.c,
	lib/lightning.c: Rework code to detect need of a "stop" to
	also handle predicates, as if a predicate is written, it
	cannot be read in the same instruction group.
	  Use a single jit_regset_t variable for all registers when
	checking need for a stop (increment value by 128 for
	float registers).
	  Correct wrong "subi" implementation, as the code executed
	is r0=im-r1, not r0=r1-im.
	  Use standard lightning 6 fpr registers, and rework to
	use callee save float registers, that may be spill/reloaded
	in prolog/epilog. This is required because some jit
	instructions implementations need to call functions; currently
	integer div/mod and float sqrt, what may change the value of
	scratch float registers.
	  Rework point of "sync" of branches that need to return a
	patch'able address, because the need for a "stop" before a
	predicate read causes all branches to be the instruction
	in slot 0, as there is no template to "stop" and branch
	in the same instruction "bundle".

2013-04-25 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning/jit_ia64.h, lib/jit_ia64-cpu.c,
	lib/jit_ia64-fpu.c, lib/jit_ia64.c: New files implementing
	the basic infrastructure of an Itanium port. The code
	compiles and can generate jit for basic hello world like
	functions.

	* check/lightning.c, configure.ac, include/lightning.h,
	include/lightning/Makefile.am, include/lightning/jit_private.h,
	lib/Makefile.am, lib/lightning.c: Update for the Itanium
	port.

	* lib/jit_mips-cpu.c, lib/jit_mips.c: Correct typo and
	make the jit_carry register local to the jit_state_t.
	This matches code reviewed in the Itanium port, that
	should use the same base logic to handle carry/borrow.

2013-04-10 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning/jit_private.h, lib/jit_arm.c,
	lib/jit_mips-cpu.c, lib/jit_mips.c, lib/jit_ppc-cpu.c,
	lib/jit_ppc.c, lib/jit_print.c, lib/jit_sparc-cpu.c,
	lib/jit_sparc.c, lib/jit_x86-cpu.c, lib/jit_x86.c,
	lib/lightning.c: Change all jit_regset macros to take
	a pointer argument, to avoid structure copies when
	adding a port to an architecture with more than 64
	registers.

2013-04-08 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_arm.c, lib/jit_ppc.c: Do not rely on __clear_cache
	aligning to the next page boundary the end argument. It may
	actually truncate it.

2013-03-29 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning/jit_private.h, lib/jit_arm.c, lib/jit_memory.c,
	lib/jit_mips.c, lib/jit_ppc.c, lib/jit_sparc.c, lib/jit_x86.c,
	lib/lightning.c: Do not start over jit generation if can grow
	the code buffer with mremap without moving the base pointer.

2013-03-29 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_memory.c: Implement a simple memory allocation wrapper
	to allow overriding calls to malloc/calloc/realloc/free, as well
	as ensuring all memory containing pointers is zero or points to
	allocated memory.

	* include/lightning.h, include/lightning/jit_private.h: Definitions
	for the memory allocation wrapper.

	* lib/Makefile.am: Update for new jit_memory.c file.

	* lib/jit_arm.c, lib/jit_disasm.c, lib/jit_mips.c, lib/jit_note.c,
	lib/jit_ppc.c, lib/jit_sparc.c, lib/jit_x86.c, lib/lightning.c:
	Use the new memory allocation wrapper code.

2013-03-22 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* configure.ac, include/lightning/jit_private.h, lib/lightning.c:
	Remove dependency on gmp. Only a simple bitmap was required, and
	that was not enough reason to force linking to gmp and possible
	complications caused by it.

2013-03-10 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning.h: Add check for __powerpc__ defined
	in Linux, while Darwin defines __ppc__.

	* include/lightning/jit_ppc.h: Adjust register definitions
	for Darwin 32 bit and Linux 64 bit ppc usage and/or ABI.

	* include/lightning/jit_private.h: Add proper check for
	Linux __powerpc__ and an data definition for an workaround
	to properly handle code that starts with a jump to a "main"
	label.

	* lib/jit_disasm.c: Add extra disassembler initialization
	for __powerpc64__.

	* lib/jit_ppc-cpu.c: Add extra macros and functions, and
	correct/adapt previous ones to handle powerpc64.

	* lib/jit_ppc-fpu.c: Adapt for 64 bit wordsize. Basically
	add conversion from/to int32/int64 and proper handling of
	load/store offsets too large for 32 bit.

	* lib/jit_ppc.c: Add calls to 64 bit codes and adaptation
	for the PowerPC 64 bit Linux ABI.

	* lib/jit_arm.c, lib/jit_mips.c, lib/jit_sparc, lib/jit_x86.c,
	lib/lightning.c: Correct off by one error when restarting jit
	of a function due to finding too late that needs to spill/reload
	some register. Problem was found by accident on a very special
	condition during PowerPC 64 code adaptation.

2013-03-08 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/lightning.c: Add missing ppc preprocessor definition.

2013-03-06 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/float.tst: Comment out the int to negative infinity
	test in mips for the moment because not all Loongson agrees
	on the result.

	* lib/jit_disasm.c: Add a test instead of an assertion
	when loading symbols for disassembly due to a failure with
	a simple binutils build in Debian mipsel64.

2013-03-06 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning/jit_private.h, lib/jit_arm-cpu.c,
	lib/jit_arm.c, lib/jit_disasm.c, lib/jit_mips-cpu.c,
	lib/jit_mips.c, lib/jit_note.c, lib/jit_ppc-cpu.c,
	lib/jit_ppc.c, lib/jit_print.c, lib/jit_sparc-cpu.c,
	lib/jit_sparc.c, lib/jit_x86-cpu.c, lib/jit_x86.c,
	lib/lightning.c: Add an extra structure for data storage
	during jit generation, and release it after generating
	jit, to reduce a bit memory usage, and also to make it
	easier to understand what data is available during
	jit runtime.

2013-03-06 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/lightning.c: Make data and code buffer readonly.

2013-02-20 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* doc/body.texi: Fool proof validate the examples of what
	an assembly-language programmer would write and correct the
	wrong sparc example.

2013-02-19 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* doc/body.texi: Add back the SPARC code generation example.

2013-02-19 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/lightning.c: Remove state flag to work with partial
	sparc port, by just disassembling if there was incomplete
	code generation.

	* jit_sparc-cpu.c: Correct wrong range check for immediate
	integer constants (off by one bit shift).
	  Correct macro implementing equivalent "rd %y, rd" assembly.
	  Implement qmul* and qdiv*.

	* jit_sparc.c: Update for qmul* and qdiv* and remove logic
	to handle incomplete code generation during sparc port.

2013-02-18 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/float.tst: Add sparc to list of known NaN and +-Inf
	to integer conversion.

	* check/lightning.c: Define __sparc__ to preprocessor in
	the sparc backend.

	* include/lightning/jit_private.h: Correct wrong definition
	of emit_stxi_d, that has lived for a long time, but would
	cause problems whenever needing to spill/reload a float
	register.

	* include/lightning/jit_sparc.h: Can only use %g2,%g3,%g4
	for scratch variables, as other "global" registers are
	reserved for the system, e.g. libc.
	  Reorder float register naming to make it easier to
	access odd float registers, so that generating code for
	pusharg and getarg is easier for the IR.

	* lib/jit_mips-cpu.c, lib/jit_ppc-cpu.c: Update to match
	new code in jit_sparc-cpu.c. It must call jit_get_reg
	with jit_class_nospill if using the register to move
	an unconditional branch address to it, as the reload
	will not happen (actually could happen in the delay
	slot...)

	* lib/jit_sparc-cpu.c: Correct wrong macro definition for
	ldxr_s.
	  Properly implement div* and implement rem. Div* needs
	to use the y register, and rem* needs to be synthesized.
	  Correct b?sub* macro definitions.

	* lib/jit_sparc-fpu.c: Correct reversed float to/from double
	conversion.
	  Correct wrong jit_get_reg call asking for a gpr and then
	using the fpr with that number.
	  Correct wrong branch displacement computation for
	conditional branches.

	* lib/jit_sparc.c: Correct getarg_d and pushargi_d implementation.
	  Add rem* entries to the switch converting IR to machine code.

	* lib/lightning.c: Correct a problem detected when adding
	the jit_class_nospill flag to jit_get_reg, that was caused
	when having a branch to an "epilog" node, what would cause
	the code to think all registers in unknown state were live,
	while in truth, all registers in unknown state in the
	"just after return" point are actually dead.

2013-02-17 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning/jit_sparc.h, lib/jit_sparc-cpu.c,
	lib/jit_sparc-fpu.c, lib/jit_sparc.c: New files implementing
	the basic framework of the sparc port.

	* configure.ac, include/lightning.h, include/lightning/Makefile.am,
	include/lightning/jit_private.h, lib/jit_disasm.c: Update
	for the sparc port framework.

	* lib/jit_mips.c: Correct reversed retr/reti logic.

	* lib/jit_ppc.c: Correct misspelled __LITTLE_ENDIAN.

	* lib/lightning.c: Always do byte hashing in hash_data, because
	the logic to "compress" strings causes large pointers to not
	be guaranteed aligned at 4 byte boundaries.
	  Update for the sparc port framework.

2013-02-11 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_arm.c: Correct jit_pushargi_f in the arm hardfp abi.
	Most of the logic uses even numbered register numbers, so that
	a float and a double can be used in the same register, but
	the abi requires packing the float arguments, so jit_pushargi_f
	needs to allocate a temporary register to modify only the
	proper register argument (or be very smart to push two
	immediate arguments if applicable).

2013-02-11 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning.h, lib/lightning.c: Implement the new
	jit_clear_state and jit_destroy_state calls. jit_clear_state
	releases all memory not required during jit_execution; that
	is, leaves only the mmap'ed data and code buffers allocated.
	jit_destroy_state releases the mmap'ed buffers as well as
	the jit_state_t object itself, that holds pointers to the
	code and data buffers, as well as annotation pointers (for
	disassembly or backtrace) in the data buffer.

	* lib/jit_note.c: Correct invalid vector offset access.

	* check/ccall.c, check/lightning.c, doc/ifib.c, doc/incr.c,
	doc/printf.c, doc/rfib.c, doc/rpn.c: Use the new jit_clear_state
	and jit_destroy_state calls, to demonstrate the new code to
	release all jit memory.

	* doc/body.texi: Add basic documentation and usage description
	of jit_clear_state and jit_destroy_state.

2013-02-11 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning/jit_private.h, lib/jit_note.c, lib/lightning.c:
	  Store all annotation information in the mmap'ed area reserved for
	read only data. This adds code to not allocate memory for jit_note_t
	objects, and to	relocate jit_line_t objects and its contents after
	calculating annotation information. The jit_line_t objects are
	relocated because it is not possible to always calculate before
	hand data layout because note information may be extended or
	redundant entries removed, as well as allowed to be added in
	non sequential order.
	  A bug was also corrected in _jit_set_note, that was causing it
	to allocate new jit_line_t objects when not needed. It was still
	working correctly, but allocating way more memory than required.

2013-02-05 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	*include/lightning.h, lib/lightning.c: Add the new jit_live code
	to explicitly mark a register as live. It is required to avoid
	assuming functions always return a value in the gpr and fpr return
	register, and to avoid the need of some very specialized codes
	that vary too much from backend to backend, to instruct the
	optimization code the return register is live.

	* lib/jit_arm.c, lib/jit_mips.c, lib/jit_ppc.c, lib/jit_print.c,
	lib/jit_x86.c: Update for the new jit_live code.

	* check/ret.ok, check/ret.tst: New files implementing a simple
	test case that would previously fail at least in ix86/x86_64.

	* check/Makefile.am: Update for new "ret" test case.

2013-02-05 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_ppc-cpu.c, lib/jit_ppc.c: Validate and correct
	problems in the qmul and qdiv ppc implementation.

2013-02-04 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning.h, include/lightning/jit_private.h,
	lib/jit_arm-cpu.c, lib/jit_arm.c, lib/jit_mips-cpu.c,
	lib/jit_mips.c, lib/jit_ppc-cpu.c, lib/jit_ppc.c,
	lib/jit_x86-cpu.c, lib/jit_x86.c, lib/lightning.c:
	Implement the new qmul and qdiv instructions that return signed
	and unsigned lo/hi multiplication result and div/rem division result.
	These should be useful for jit translation of code that needs to
	know if a multiplication overflows (no branch opcode added) or if
	a division is exact (easy check if remainder is zero).

	* check/lightning.c, lib/jit_print.c, check/Makefile.am,
	check/all.tst: Update for the new qmul and qdiv instructions.

	* check/qalu.inc, check/qalu_div.ok, check/qalu_div.tst,
	check/qalu_mul.ok, check/qalu_mul.tst: New files implementing
	simple test cases for qmul and qdiv.

2013-01-30 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* doc/body.texi: Correct "jmpi" description that incorrectly
	told it was possible to pass any address as jump target. The
	only way to do that is "movi+jmpr".

2013-01-30 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_x86-cpu.c: Correct undefined behavior code.
	http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56143

2013-01-29 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* configure.ac: Use AC_CONFIG_HEADERS instead of AC_CONFIG_HEADER
	to have HAVE_CONFIG_H defined with latest aclocal.

	* include/lightning/jit_private.h, lib/lightning.c: Add new
	abstraction to use an heuristic to calculate amount of space
	required for jit generation, and code to reallocate buffer if
	did miscalculate it.

	* lib/jit_arm.c, lib/jit_mips.c, lib/jit_ppc.c, lib/jit_x86.c:
	Update to use new code to estimate and resize of required buffer
	for jit code.

	* lib/jit_x86-cpu.c: Minor cosmetic change to avoid adding a
	non required rex prefix when calling a function pointer stored
	in a register.

2013-01-24 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/Makefile.am: "make debug" target should pass only
	the main test tool program as argument for running gdb

	* configure.ac: Add the --enable-assertions options.

	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/body.texi, doc/lightning.texi:
	Major rewrite of the documentation to match the current
	implementation.

	* doc/version.texi: Automatic date update.

	* doc/ifib.c, doc/incr.c, doc/printf.c, doc/rfib.c, doc/rpn.c:
	Implementation of the documentation examples, that are also
	compiled during a normal build.

	* doc/p-lightning.texi, doc/porting.texi, doc/toc.texi,
	doc/u-lightning.texi, doc/using.texi: These files were
	renamed in the documentation rewrite, as the documentation
	was significantly trimmed due to full removal of the porting
	chapters. Better porting documentation should be added but
	for the moment it was just removed the documentation not
	matching the implementation.

2013-01-18 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_note.c: Correct bounds check and wrong code keeping
	a pointer that could be changed after a realloc call.

2013-01-18 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/3to2.tst, check/add.tst, check/allocai.tst, check/bp.tst,
	check/call.tst, check/ccall.c, check/clobber.tst, check/divi.tst,
	check/fib.tst, check/ldsti.tst, check/ldstr-c.tst, check/ldstr.tst,
	check/ldstxi-c.tst, check/ldstxi.tst, check/ldstxr-c.tst,
	check/ldstxr.tst, check/lightning.c, check/rpn.tst, check/stack.tst,
	check/varargs.tst, include/lightning.h,
	include/lightning/jit_private.h, lib/jit_arm.c, lib/jit_disasm.c,
	lib/jit_mips.c, lib/jit_note.c, lib/jit_ppc.c, lib/jit_print.c,
	lib/jit_x86.c, lib/lightning.c:	Extend the "jit_note" abstraction
	with the new "jit_name" call, that receives a string argument, and
	should usually be called to mark boundaries of functions of code
	generating jit (that is, it is not expected that the language
	generating jit map its functions to jit functions).

2013-01-17 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/add.tst, check/allocai.tst, check/bp.tst, check/divi.tst,
	check/fib.tst, check/lightning.c, include/lightning/jit_arm.h,
	include/lightning/jit_mips.h, include/lightning/jit_ppc.h,
	include/lightning/jit_private.h, include/lightning/jit_x86.h:
	Make JIT_RET, JIT_FRET and JIT_SP private. These should not be
	used in any operations due to frequently having special
	constraints (usually JIT_FRET). JIT_FP must be made available
	because it must be used as the base register to access stack
	space allocated with jit_allocai.

2013-01-14 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning.h, lib/lightning.c: Add an extra align
	argument to the jit_data call (that should be made private),
	so that it should not align strings at 8 bytes.
	  Correct the jit_note call to include the null ending byte
	when adding label/note names to the "jit data section".

2013-01-11 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_note.c: New file implementing a simple string+integer
	annotation, that should be used to map filename and line number
	to offsets in the generated jit.

	* include/lightning.h, lib/lightning.c: Update for the new
	note code.
	  Add an extra mandatory argument to init_jit, that is used
	as argument to bfd_openr.
	  Change from generic void* to char* the argument to jit_note
	and add an extra integer argument, to map to filename and
	line number.

	* check/ccall.c, check/lightning.c, include/lightning/jit_private.h,
	lib/jit_arm.c, lib/jit_disasm.c, lib/jit_mips.c, lib/jit_ppc.c,
	lib/jit_print.c, lib/jit_x86.c: lib/Makefile.am: Update for the
	new annotation code.

	* configure.ac, check/Makefile.am: Update to work with latest
	automake.

2013-01-09 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning.h, lib/jit_arm.c, jit_mips-fpu.c,
	lib/jit_mips.c, lib/jit_print.c, lib/jit_x86.c, lib/lightning.c:
	Remove the jit_code_getarg_{f,d} and jit_code_pusharg{i,r}_{f,d}
	calls, replacing them with the new, internal only, jit_movr_w_f,
	jit_mov{r,i}_f_w, jit_movr_ww_d, and jit_mov{i,r}_d_ww, that
	better describe the operation being done, and allow removing
	the hackish code to detect special conditions for arm when
	moving from/to vfp from/to a grp register pair.
	Rename jit_code_retval_{f,d} to jit_code_x86_retval_{f,d} as
	it is specific to 32 bit x86, and used to move abi return
	value in x87 register to a sse register.

2013-01-05 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/cccall.c, check/ccall.ok: New test case to validate
	interleaved calls from/to C code and jit.

	* check/Makefile.am: Update for the new ccall test case.

	* include/lightning.h, lib/lightning.c: Add the new jit_address
	call that returns the real/final address of a "note" in the
	generated jit. It requires a jit_node_t as returned by the
	jit_note call, and is only valid after calling jit_emit.
	  Add an intermediate solution to properly handle arm
	soft and softfp modes that move a double to an integer register
	pair. Currently it just adds extra tests for the condition,
	but the proper solution should be to have extra lightning
	codes for these conditions, codes which should be only used
	by the backends that need it, and merged with the existing
	jit_pusharg*_{f,d}.

	* include/lightning/jit_private.h: Add new jit_state_t flag
	to know it finished jit_emit, so that calls to jit_address
	are valid.

	* lib/jit_mips.c: Correct abi implementation so that the
	new ccall test case pass. Major problem was using
	_jit->function.self.arg{i,f} as boolean values, but that
	would cause lightning.c:patch_registers() to incorrectly
	assume only one register was used as argument when calling
	jit_regarg_p(); _jit->function.self.arg{i,f} must be the
	number of registers used as arguments (in all backends).

	* lib/jit_x86.c: Add workaround, by marking %rax as used,
	to a special condition, when running out of registers and the
	allocator trying to spill and reload %rax, but %rax was used
	as a pointer to a function, what would cause the reload to
	destroy the return value. This condition can be better
	generalized, but the current solution is good enough.

	* include/lightning/jit_ppc.h, lib/jit_ppc-cpu.c, lib/jit_ppc.c:
	Rewrite logic to handle arguments, as the original code was
	written based on a SysV pdf about the generic powerpc ABI,
	what did "invent" a new abi for the previous test cases, but
	failed in the new ccall test in Darwin PPC. Now it properly
	handles 13 float registers for arguments, as well as proper
	computation of stack offsets when running out of registers
	for arguments.

2013-01-02 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/float.tst: Correct test case to match ppc also
	converting positive infinity to 0x7fffffff.

	* lib/jit_arm-swf.c: Correct typos with double underscores.

	* lib/lightning.c: Correct remaining wrong reverse jump logic.

2012-12-29 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/lightning.c: Correct both, wrong and confusing logic
	to compute the reverse of a jump. Now it properly matches
	C semantics for "eq" (==) and "ne" (!=) and correct computation
	of reverse of "uneq" as "gt".

	* check/branch.tst: Update "ne" float branch check that
	previously happened to be wrongly tested with a NaN argument.

2012-12-29 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/float.ok, check/float.tst: New test cases implementing
	extensive validation of float comparison and branch code
	generation as well as integer conversion, involving NaN and
	[+-]Inf.

	* lib/jit_arm-swf.c, lib/jit_x86-sse.c, lib/jit_x86-x87.c:
	Correct bugs found by new float test case.

	* lib/jit_x86.c: Correct cut&paste error added in commit to
	convert jit_arg* return value to a jit_node_t*,	that would
	cause it to not properly handle double arguments in ix86.

	* check/Makefile.am: Update for the new test case.

2012-12-28 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/lightning.c, include/lightning.h, lib/jit_arm.c,
	lib/jit_mips.c, lib/jit_ppc.c, lib/jit_print.c,	lib/jit_x86.c,
	lib/lightning.c: Change return value of jit_arg{,_f,_d} to
	a jit_node_t* object, that should be used as argument to
	jit_getarg_{c,uc,s,us,i,ui,l,f,d}. This just requires changing
	from jit_int32_t to jit_pointer_t (or jit_node_t*) the "handle"
	for the getarg calls, with the benefit that it makes it easy
	to implement patching of the stack address of non register
	arguments, this way allowing to implement variable size stack
	frames if applicable; useful if there are too many registers and
	jit functions uses only a few callee save registers.

2012-12-27 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_arm.c, lib/jit_mips-cpu.c, lib/jit_mips.c: Correct
	regressions when patching jit_calli for a forward function.

	* lib/jit_ppc-cpu.c: Correct wrong arguments to ANDI opcode
	in jit_getarg_u{c,s} implementation.

2012-12-23 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/call.ok, check/call.tst: New test cases to validate
	simple typed argument and return values in function calls.

	* check/lightning.c: Properly handle jit_movi of labels for
	backward and forward code labels.

	* check/Makefile.am: Update for new test case.

2012-12-23 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/carry.ok, check/carry.tst: New test case to validate
	carry condition handling.

	* check/Makefile.am: Update for new test case.

2012-12-22 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_ppc-cpu.c, lib/jit_ppc.c: Implement logic for
	jit_htonr for big endian, so that ppc (big endian) pass the
	new clobber.tst test case.

2012-12-22 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_arm.c: Correct use of wrong argument offset
	variable in armv7l or float/double argument for varargs
	function in armv7hl.
	  Correct jit_getarg* logic in software float mode to
	match expected behavior in other backends, that is, if
	a function is not called, it is safe to use a few lightning
	calls before a next jit_getarg* call, as done in the test
	case check/stack.tst. The proper solution should be to
	extend the parser in lib/lightning.c to check if there is
	some float operation that will call some (libgcc?) function,
	but software float arm should be a very uncommon backend for
	lightning, so, just load the already in place arguments
	saved to stack, assuming the register argument was clobbered
	(what should not be the case most times...).

2012-12-22 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/clobber.ok, check/clobber.tst: New test case doing
	extensive validation tests to ensure registers not used in
	a operation are not clobbered.

	* check/Makefile.am: Update for new test case.

2012-12-21 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/lightning.c: Partially rewrite/revert code to compute
	initial	register live state at the start of a basic block.
	The original logic was corrupted when adding optimizations
	to do as few computations as possible in jit_update. The
	reglive field must be always a known set of live registers
	at the start of a basic block. The value that was incorrect
	was the regmask field, that must be the set of registers
	that are in unknown state, because they are not known live,
	neither set (or possibly not set) in the basic block, and
	*must* store the state at the start of the basic block.

2012-12-20 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning/jit_ppc.h: Correct mismatch of JIT_F{1,5}
	with enum codes, that were correct, and returned by jit_f().

	* lib/jit_ppc-cpu.c, lib/jit_ppc-fpu.c, lib/jit_ppc.c: Properly
	implement and better describe values when generating stack
	frames.

2012-12-18 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/stack.ok, check/stack.tst: New files to test data
	integrity on a deep chain of stack frames.

	* lib/jit_arm.c, lib/jit_arm-cpu.c, lib/jit_mips.c,
	lib/jit_mips-cpu.c, lib/jit_ppc.c, lib/jit_ppc-cpu.c,
	lib/jit_x86.c, lib/jit_x86-cpu.c: Calculate _jit->function->stack
	in the emit stage, otherwise it will calculate it wrong if
	need to jit_allocai space to spill registers.

	* lib/lightning.c: Correct wrong offset when updating the
	"current" jit function pointer in the code that may need to
	allocate stack space to spill registers.

	* check/lightning.c: Correct off by one data space check.

	* check/Makefile.am: Update for new test case.

2012-12-17 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/fop_abs.ok, check/fop_abs.tst, check/fop_sqrt.ok,
	check/fop_sqrt.tst: New files implementing simple test cases
	for the extra float operations.

	* check/Makefile.am: Update for new test cases.

	* check/alu.inc: Add an extra macro to check for unordered
	equality on tests where it is expected to use NaN as an
	argument.

	* check/lightning.c: Minor change for proper/common argument
	syntax handling ommiting arguments to options.

2012-12-17 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/Makefile.am: Automatically generate pattern list
	of tests with alternate jit generation options. This should
	prevent typos and needing to change multiple places after
	a change.

2012-12-14 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/lightning.c: Remove the ".cpu name value" syntax,
	as it was not able to do proper changes before the jit
	internal data structure was initialized. Now it supports
	several getopt options to force using different jit
	generation options, effectively replacing the previous
	syntax.

	* check/run-test: Add simple extra logic to handle differently
	named test scripts, used to test things like x87 coprocessor
	in ix86, and arm instruction set or software float in armv7l.

	* configure.ac: Add some AC_RUN_IFELSE calls to figure at
	compile time if can test different code generation options,
	and update Makefile generation accordingly.

	* check/Makefile.am, lib/jit_arm.c, lib/jit_x86.c: Update to
	properly work with the test tool updating the jit_cpu global
	information.

	* check/check.arm.sh, check/check.swf.sh, check/check.x87.sh:
	New wrapper files passing -mthumb=0, mvfp=0 and -mx87=1 to
	the test tool, if applicable, so that it can validate alternate
	code generation options on test hosts that support them.

2012-12-14 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_x86-x87.c, lib/jit_x86.c: Correct test cases in ix86
	when using the x87 coprocessor instead of sse2+.

2012-12-14 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning.h, include/lightning/jit_private.h,
	lib/jit_arm.c, lib/jit_mips.c, lib/jit_ppc.c, lib/jit_x86.c,
	lib/lightning.c: Make jit_ellipsis implementation not
	backend specific. It is not intended to handle va_list
	like objects at runtime, as jit_arg* and jit_getarg*
	return constant values resolved at parse time, so, effectively
	it is not possible to create printf like jit functions, as
	there is no va_start, va_arg, va_end, etc, abstraction. This
	limitation should be kept for the sake of making new ports
	easier.

2012-12-14 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning.h, lib/lightning.c: Add two extra wrapper
	functions to avoid need for excess pointer to/from word casts.

	* check/lightning.c: Only need for pointer to/from word cast
	now is jit_movi, update accordingly.

2012-12-13 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/varargs.ok, check/varargs.tst: New test cases implementing
	simple varargs calls with a large amount of arguments to exercise
	excess arguments on stack.

	* include/lightning.h: Include config.h if HAVE_CONFIG_H is
	defined.

	* lib/jit_arm.c: Allocate a fpr register, not a gpr one for
	temporary when pushing varargs arguments in the stack.

	* lib/jit_arm-swf.c: Correct code changing the wrong offset
	in jit_absr_d and jit_negr_d in software float.

	* lib/jit_mips.c: Correct calculation of offsets of arguments
	on stack.

	* lib/jit_ppc.c: Correct bogus logic for "next" offset of arguments
	on stack and adjust for fixed offset of stack arguments.

2012-12-12 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning.h, lib/jit_arm.c, lib/jit_mips.c,
	lib/jit_ppc.c, lib/jit_x86.c, lib/lightning.c: Change jit_prepare
	to no longer receive an argument. If receiving an argument, it
	should be an ABI specifier, not a boolean if varargs or not,
	and add the new jit_ellipsis call, to specify where the
	ellipsis is in the C prototype of the function being called.
	Note that currently it is not supported to define varargs
	functions and it will be ignored if calling jit_ellipsis not
	in a prepare/finish* block, but this should be addressed.

	* check/allocai.tst, check/alu_add.tst, check/alu_and.tst,
	check/alu_com.tst, check/alu_div.tst, check/alu_lsh.tst,
	check/alu_mul.tst, check/alu_neg.tst, check/alu_or.tst,

	check/ldstxr-c.tst, check/ldstxr.tst, check/rpn.tst,
	check/lightning.c: Update for the change to jit_prepare and
	addition of jit_ellipsis.

2012-12-11 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_ppc-cpu.c: Make movr a function that checks arguments
	so that other code can safely assume it is a noop if src and dst
	are the same register.
	  Implement rem{r,i}{,_u} as a div{,u}/mul/sub.
	  Correct ANDIS, ORIS and XORIS calls to cast the argument to
	unsigned before the shift to avoid an assertion if the argument
	had the topmost bit set.
	  Implement lshi, rshi and rshi_u as functions to test for a
	zero argument, that would otherwise trigger an assertion when
	computing the shift value.
	  Do a simple implementation of bm{s,c}{r,i} with a temporary,
	"andr" of arguments and jump based on comparison with zero.
	  Correct typo in ldxi_c.

	* lib/jit_ppc-fpu.c: Correct wrong arguments to FDIV* and STF*.

	* lib/jit_ppc.c: Correct wrong check for 6 instead of 8 integer
	arguments in registers. If calling a varargs function and
	passing a float or double argument, also either store the
	value in the stack or in integer registers, as varargs functions
	do not fetch it from float registers.
	  Add "case" for new functions and incorrectly missing ones.
	  Call libgcc's __clear_cache, that should know what to do
	if the hardware needs flushing cache before execution.

	* lib/lightning.c: Do a simple/trivial logic in jit_regset_scan1,
	that should make it easier for the compiler to optimize it, and
	that also corrects the previously wrong code for big endian, and
	that was causing problems in ppc due to not saving all callee save
	registers as it was not "finding" them in the regset due to the
	little endian assumption bug.

2012-12-11 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* configure.ac: Only default to using the builtin disassembler
	if on GNU/Linux. This should be temporary, due to requiring
	/proc/self/exe.
	  Correctly check $target_cpu for powerpc.

	* include/lightning/jit_ppc.h: Correctly implement jit_v_num.

	* include/lightning/jit_private.h: Declare proper prototype
	for jit_init_debug and jit_finish_debug.

	* lib/jit_ppc-cpu.c: Remove code to save/restore callee save
	float registers, as it is not required since those float
	registers are not usable currently.
	  Change prolog and epilog generation to, at least comparing
	code, match what gcc generates in "gcc -O0", but it is still
	failing in Darwin PPC, apparently due to the __clear_cache
	call not being enough, as frequently it will also fail to
	execute, and the code buffer is all zeroes.

	* lib/lightning.c: Do not fail in jit_regset_scan1 calls due
	to passing 64 as argument on computers with 64 registers.

2012-12-10 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_mips-cpu.c: Correct all current test cases.
	  Call the "xori" not the "XORI" macro for jit_xori implementation,
	as the XORI macro handles only 16 bit unsigned values.
	  Call the "movr" macro, not the "movi" macro in the special
	case of adding or subtracting zero.
	  Use the proper temporary register in the jit_andr implementation.

2012-12-09 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/alu.inc, check/alu_add.ok, check/alu_add.tst,
	check/alu_and.ok, check/alu_and.tst, check/alu_com.ok,
	check/alu_com.tst, check/alu_div.ok, check/alu_div.tst,
	check/alu_lsh.ok, check/alu_lsh.tst, check/alu_mul.ok,

	check/alux_sub.ok, check/alux_sub.tst, check/branch.ok,
	check/branch.tst: New test cases for arithmetic and branch
	tests.

	* check/Makefile.am: Update for new test cases.

	* include/lightning/jit_private.h: Make the jit_reg_free_p
	macro shared by all backends. Previously was added for the
	arm backend, but is useful in the x86_64 backend when checking
	state of "special purpose register".
	Also add the new jit_class_named register class, that must be
	or'ed with the register value if calling jit_get_reg expecting
	an specific value, because the specific register value may be
	zero, that previously was treated as no register requested.

	* lib/jit_arm-cpu.c: Correct argument order for T2_MVN.

	* lib/jit_arm-swf.c: Call the proper function for double
	divide. The "software float" implementation just calls
	libgcc functions.

	* lib/jit_arm.c: Return float/double values in the float
	register if using the hard float ABI.

	* lib/jit_x86-cpu.c: Change the can_sign_extend_int_p macro
	to not include -0x80000000L, because there is code that
	"abuses" it and thinks it can negate the immediate value
	after calling that macro.
	  Correct implementation of jit_subi that had a wrong code
	patch logic doing subtraction with reversed arguments.
	  Correct REX prefix calculation in the jit_muli implementation.
	  Correct logic to get/unget %*ax and %*dx registers in divremr
	and divremi.
	  Correct divremi that was using the symbolic, unique %*ax
	value in on place (not using the _REGNO name suffix).
	  Correct cut&paste error causing it to use "xor" instead of
	"or" in one code path of the jit_ori implementation.
	  Correct several flaws when clobbering registers and/or when
	one of the arguments was %*cx in the rotshr wrapper function
	implementing most shift operations.

	* lib/lightning.c: No longer expect that the backend be smart
	enough to know what to do when asking for a named register
	if that register is already an argument or is live. It fails
	if it is an argument, or if register is live, fails if cannot
	spill.
	  No longer incorrectly assume that eqr_{f,d} and ltgr_{f,d} are
	safe to inverse value tests in jump thread optimization.

2012-12-05 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/Makefile.am, check/cvt.ok, check/cvt.tst: Add new
	"cvt" test case to test conversion from/to int/float types.

	* check/lightning.c: Only define truncr_{f,d}_l in 64 bit mode.

	* include/lightning.h: Correct typo that caused it to define
	jit_truncr_{f,d}_l in 32 bit mode.

	* lib/jit_arm-cpu.c: Avoid assertion failure in the signed/unsigned
	extend opcodes generation as it shares an interface for 3 argument
	opcode generation.

	* lib/jit_x86-cpu.c: Correct wrong argument passed to
	jit_unget_reg in the andi implementation and wrong byte
	unsigned extend code generation.

	* lib/jit_x86-sse.c: Correct conversion from "word" to float or
	double as is dependent on wordsize.

2012-12-05 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/ldstr-c.ok, check/ldstr-c.tst, check/ldstxi-c.ok,
	check/ldstxi-c.tst, check/ldstxr-c.ok, check/ldstxr-c.tst:
	New test case files testing load clobbering the base and/or
	index register;

	* check/ldst.inc: New file with common definition for all the
	ldst* test cases.

	check/Makefile.am, check/ldsti.tst, check/ldstr.tst,
	check/ldstxi.tst, check/ldstxr.tst: Update for new common
	definitions file and new register clobber ldst tests.

2012-12-05 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_mips-fpu.c: Correct wrong register order in stxr_{f,d}
	in the mips backend.

2012-12-05 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_arm-vfp.c: Correct regression found in armv7l with
	latest test cases.

2012-12-05 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/ldstxi.tst, check/ldstxr.tst: Correct wrong argument
	order for 32 bit mode tests.

	* configure.ac: Correct check for ix86 target_cpu.

2012-12-05 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/ldstr.ok, check/ldstr.tst, check/ldsti.ok,
	check/ldsti.tst, check/ldstxr.ok, check/ldstxr.tst,
	check/ldstxi.ok, check/ldstxi.tst:
	New test case files exercising a very large amount of
	register combinations to verify load/store implementation.

	* check/Makefile.am: Update for new test cases.

	* lib/jit_x86-cpu.c: Correct wrong argument order when
	computing REX prefix for {ld,st}r_T codes;

2012-12-04 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_mips-fpu.c, lib/jit_mips.c: Implement missing mips
	jit_sqrtr_{f,d} codes.

	* check/all.tst, include/lightning.h, lib/jit_print.c: Change
	declaration order and call order in all.tst of {add,sub}c and
	{add,sub}x. *c must be called before to set the carry and *x
	second to use the carry and keep it set. The wrong call order
	was causing all.tst to fail in mips, where a register is
	allocated to keep a global carry state.

2012-12-04 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning/jit_mips.h, lib/jit_mips-cpu.c,
	lib/jit_mips-fpu.c, lib/jit_mips.c: Correct float/double
	argument handling and make the mips backend pass the initial
	test cases.

	* include/lightning.h, ib/jit_print.c, lib/lightning.c:
	Add extra enum values for argument handling functions that
	could not be abstracted to the current codes, that is, when
	float values need to move from/to gpr from/to fpr. It would
	be more tempting to add such primitives, but they would have
	wordsize limitations, and it is not expected to add codes
	with one gpr argument for 64 bit and two for 32 bit.

	* lib/jit_ppc.c: Check _jit->function before calling jit_epilog()
	to avoid a runtime exception.

2012-12-04 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* include/lightning/jit_mips.h, lib/jit_mips.c: Update to
	make the mips backend compile in a qemu image.

	* lib/jit_ppc.c: Minor adaptations to help in having the
	ppc backend compilable.

2012-12-03 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* configure.ac, include/lightning/jit_private.h, lib/jit_arm-cpu.c,
	lib/jit_arm-swf.c, lib/jit_arm.c, check/Makefile.am: Correct
	implementation of the arm backend port to build and pass the
	current test cases. Tested on armv7 with softfp abi.

	* lib/jit_disasm.c: Rename and change prototype of static
	disassemble function as in the arm backend it is required
	to access state information stored in the jit_state_t object.

	* check/3to2.tst, check/add.tst: Correct test case code assuming
	JIT_RO and JIT_RET are the same, and even if they are the same,
	the logic was incorrect because it must always call jit_retval*
	to fetch a function call return before any other instruction.
	The arm backend hash a special condition if jit_retval is not
	called, because "r0" is not JIT_R0, but is JIT_RET and *also*
	the first argument for a called function, so JIT_RET must be
	only used as an argument to jit_retval.

2012-12-03 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/all.tst, check/lightning.c: Only declare or use 64 bit
	interfaces on 64 bit builds.

	* check/fib.tst: Use simpler logic to not need preprocessor
	conditionals for 32 or 64 bit.

	* include/lightning.h: Only declare 64 bit macros on a 64 bit
	build. Code using lightning must know about wordsize and the
	jit generation limitations, also, this way it generates a
	compile time failure, not a runtime assertion.

	* include/lightning/jit_x86.h: Correct typo in macro name.

	* lib/jit_arm.c, lib/jit_arm-cpu.c, lib/jit_mips.c,
	lib/jit_mips-cpu.c, lib/jit_ppc.c, lib/jit_ppc-cpu.c, 
	lib/jit_x86.c, lib/jit_x86-cpu.c: Correct wrong code to get
	current jit function pointer.

	* lib/lightning.c: Move call to the simplify() optimization
	to after register liveness is known. Previous code did work
	by accident but now with proper test cases the problem was
	noticed.

	* lib/jit_disasm.c: Always cast bfd_vma to long long when
	passing it as printf argument.

2012-12-03 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* configure.ac, check/Makefile.am, check/check.sh,
	doc/Makefile.am, include/lightning/Makefile.am,
	lib/Makefile.am: Correct make distcheck.

2012-12-02 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_ppc.c: Assign copyright ownership to FSF.

	* lib/jit_x86-cpu.c: Correct integer multiplication that was
	generating code with reversed register arguments.

	* check/rpn.ok, check/rpn.tst: New test case file.

2012-12-02 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* lib/jit_x86-cpu.c, lib/jit_x86-sse.c, lib/jit_x86-x87.c:
	Actually change copyright owner to FSF as avertised.

	*  lib/jit_arm-cpu.c,  lib/jit_arm-swf.c,

	lib/jit_mips-cpu.c, lib/jit_mips-fpu.c, lib/jit_mips.c,
	lib/jit_ppc-cpu.c, lib/jit_ppc-fpu.c, lib/jit_ppc.c: New
	files implementing initial code different jit backends.

	* include/lightning/jit_private.h: Add extra field to the
	private jit_patch_t type, required by the arm port.

	* lib/Makefile.am: Update for the new backend implementation
	files.

2012-12-02 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/Makefile.am: Add proper "make clean" rule and missing
	check.sh to EXTRA_DIST.

2012-12-02 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* .gitignore: Update pattern of ignored files.

	* check/Makefile.am: Add rule to build liblightning.la dependency
	in case of running "make check" before building the library.

2012-12-02 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* check/3to2.ok, check/3to2.tst, check/add.ok, check/add.tst,
	check/allocai.ok, check/allocai.tst, check/bp.ok, check/bp.tst,
	check/divi.ok, check/divi.tst, check/fib.ok, check/fib.tst:
	New sample input for the new test program, loosely matching
	several of the previous test cases.

	* check/Makefile.am: New test suite makefile.

	* check/check.sh, check/run-test: New wrapper files for the
	new test suite.

	* check/lightning.c: New file. The main driver of the new test
	suite, that compiles to a parser of a very simple assembly like
	language, generates jit and executes it.

	* check/all.tst: New file. A generic debug and sample test file
	with a directive to prevent it from being executed, and useful to
	read disassembly of all possible instructions, using a fixed set
	of registers.

	* include/Makefile.am, include/lightning.h,
	include/lightning/Makefile.am, include/lightning/jit_arm.h,

	lib/jit_x86-cpu.c, lib/jit_x86-sse.c, lib/jit_x86-x87.c,
	lib/jit_x86.c, lib/lightning.c: New files. These files are
	written from scratch, only by <pcpa@gnu.org>, and have now
	copyright assignment to the FSF. This is the core of the new
	lightning rework. Previously it was integrated in code with
	a garbage collector and several custom types like vectors and
	hash tables, so this first code merge with lightning converts
	that code into a library extracting only the jit bits, and at
	first only for x86_64 GNU/Linux.

	* lightning.h, m4/lightning.m4: Removed. These are no longer
	required in the new lightning code.

	.gitignore, Makefile.am, configure.ac: Update for the new
	lightning code.

2012-12-02 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>
	* .cvsignore: Removed for extra cleanup.

	* build-aux: Rename directory to m4.

	* m4: Renamed to "default" name and for consistency with merge
	with code rework to be imported in lightning.

	* .gitignore, configure.ac, Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.am:
	Update for build-aux to m4 rename.

2012-12-01 Paulo Andrade <pcpa@gnu.org>

	* opcode/Makefile.am, opcode/Makefile.in, opcode/ansidecl.h,
	opcode/bfd.h, opcode/dis-asm.h, opcode/dis-buf.c, opcode/disass.c,
	opcode/i386-dis.c, opcode/i386.h, opcode/ppc-dis.c, opcode/ppc-opc.c,
	opcode/ppc.h, opcode/sparc-dis.c, opcode/sparc-opc.c, opcode/sparc.h,
	opcode/sysdep.h: Removed. Do not bundle GNU binutils files.

	* aclocal.m4, configure, Makefile.in, config.h.in, doc/Makefile.in,
	lightning/Makefile.in, tests/Makefile.in: Removed. Do not maintain
	autogenerated files that also generate too much diff noise when
	regenerated in git.

	* build-aux/help2man, build-aux/texinfo.tex, build-aux/texi2dvi:
	Removed. Buildenvironment must have an up to date version from
	upstream installed.

	* build-aux/config.guess, build-aux/config.sub, build-aux/depcomp,
	build-aux/install-sh build-aux/mdate-sh build-aux/missing: Removed.
	Do not maintain a copy of automake files in git. Release tarballs
	must use an up to date version.

	* lightningize.in, doc/lightningize.1: Removed. Do not encourage
	bundling lightning in other packages. It should use a system package
	or a proper thirdy part subdirectory.

	* INSTALL: Removed. Autoreconf removes it and creates a symlink
	when regenerating files, so, avoid conflicts in git and let
	automake create the symlink.

	* .gitignore: Add INSTALL and autogenerated files.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am: Update for removal of opcode subdir,
	auto generated files and lightningize.

	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/3to2.c, tests/add.c, tests/bp.c,
	tests/fib.c, tests/fibdelay.c, tests/fibit.c, tests/funcfp.c,
	tests/incr.c, tests/printf.c, tests/rpn.c, tests/rpnfp.c,
	tests/sete.c, tests/testfp.c: Update for removal of opcode subdir.

	* doc/Makefile.am: Update for removal of lightningize.

	* configure.ac, lightning/ppc/funcs.h, lightning/sparc/funcs.h,
	lightning/i386/fp.h, lightning/i386/core.h, lightning/i386/asm.h,

	tests/fibit.c, tests/funcfp.c, tests/incr.c, tests/printf.c,
	tests/rpn.c, tests/rpnfp.c, tests/sete.c, tests/testfp.c:
	Remove LIGHTNING_CROSS, it is half supported and incomplete.

	* tests/3to2.c, tests/funcfp.c, tests/rpnfp.c: Remove preprocessor
	check on JIT_FPR. If no hardware registers are available, the backend
	must provide an alternative for software float.

	* lightning/ppc/core.h, lightning/sparc/core.h, tests/Makefile.am:
	Remove JIT_NEED_PUSH_POP. It is absolutely not trivial to implement
	properly on some backends due to stack alignment constraints, and
	whenever it is required, using jit_allocai and using a properly
	aligned stack vector, or a heap buffer, is better.

	* tests/push-pop.c, tests/push-pop.ok: Removed due to
	JIT_NEED_PUSH_POP no longer available.

2011-02-28  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	* lightning/i386/core-64.h: Add jit_add{c,x}{i,r}_l, jit_mulr_{l,ul}_,

	incorrect. Should have been 4 bytes below SP (not above).
	* lightning/ppc/core.h (jit_popr_i): The offset for the load was 
	incorrect. Should have been 0 (not +8).

	alignment.
	(jit_ret): Always use LEAVE.

2008-06-13  Laurent Michel  <ldm@thorgal.homelinux.org>

	* lightning/i386/core-64.h: Add (void) casts for C++ compatibility.
	* lightning/i386/asm.h: Likewise.
